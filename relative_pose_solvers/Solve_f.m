%Solve_f computes focal length from a fundamental matrix.
%
%f = Solve_f(F)
%   Given the fundamental matrix, F, that captures the epipolar geometry of
%   two cameras, both of which have the same but unknown focal length, this
%   function returns the focal length of the two cameras.
%
%   Although the fundamental matrix embodies both the intrinsic parameters
%   (cameras' focal lengths and principal points) and extrinsic parameters
%   (relative orientation and translation between the two cameras), it only
%   has 7 degrees of freedom.  This limits the number of recoverable
%   parameters to 7.  There are 5 extrinsic parameters (3 rotation angles
%   and 2 components of the translation vector - note that the translation
%   vector is recoverable only up to an unknown scale).  So only 2
%   intrinsic parameters can be estimated, namely the cameras' focal
%   lengths.
%
%   The code implemented here is based on the algorithm described in the
%   following paper:
%   G. N. Newsam, D. Q. Huynh, M. J. Brooks, H.-P. Pan.
%   "Recovering Unknown Focal Lengths in Self-Calibration: An Essentially
%   Linear Algorithm and Degenerate Configurations."
%   International Archives of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 
%   vol XXXI, part B3, commission III, pp. 575-580, Vienna, Austria,
%   9-19 July 1996.
%   
%   The algorithm assumes that the principal points of both cameras are
%   known and that the origin of the image coordinate system has been fixed
%   at the locations of the known principal points when the fundamental
%   matrix, F, was computed.
%
%   If the input F matrix was poorly estimated then it is possible that
%   the function failed to compute the focal length.  In this case, a
%   message would be displayed and the focal length would be set to 0.
%
%   Use Solve_2f.m if the two cameras are not identical.
